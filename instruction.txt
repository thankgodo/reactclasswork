Build a four page website using ReactJs and react router Dom for routing. 
All pages will maintain the same header and footer, with navigation to each page's route on the header. 

The pages include : 

Home Page
Create Profile Page
Delete Profile Page
Color Page. Page

The colour page should have a button that changes the background colour to at least five colours.

 

Note: all pages must carry the same profile that was created using the profile page, 
and the delete page is the only page u can delete the profiles globally 

Goodluck!!
